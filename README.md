# rtweet_citations

A repository for tracking citations/references/uses of [rtweet](http://rtweet.info) in published articles because (a) people aren't always great about using appropriate citations for R packages, (b) Google scholar hasn't been great at locating/tracking rtweet citations, and (c) I'd like to one day get tenure :).
